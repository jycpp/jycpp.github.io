星球大战正片一共三部九集，分别是正传、前传和后传，每一部又分为三集，每集都有一个主题，是难得的美国大片中的经典。随着去年底后传第三集的上映，星球大战的时间线也逐渐清晰起来，整个故事也画了完美的句号。

The relationship among the three Star Wars films is a bit of a mystery. There is no clear chronological order to them, but they are all based on the same premise: the Jedi are trying to stop the Separatist forces from taking over the galaxy. The first two films are prequels to the third, and the third is the sequel to the first two.


The character of Anakin Skywalker is a bit of a mystery, but he is a very powerful Jedi, and he is also trying to stop the Separatist forces from taking over the galaxy, but he is captured by dark side and then becomes a Sith Lord.

The following is a mermaid graph of the Star Wars characters and their relationships.

    Anakin[Anakin Skywalker] -->|Son| Luke[Luke Skywalker];
    Anakin -->|Daughter| Leia[Leia Organa];
    Padme[Padme Amidala] -->|Mother| Luke;
```


And this is more complex graph of the Star Wars characters and their relationships.

And now let us review the three Star Wars films in chronological order.


## 1. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace

![20250326233911](https://s2.loli.net/2025/03/26/feEU1ac8ugSmDyi.png)

*Release date: May 19, 1999*

If you want to watch all the Star Wars movies in chronological order then sadly your marathon starts with the very first (and pretty awful) prequel movie. And it doesn't get much more prequel than Darth Vader as a 10-year-old kid. This film sees Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi discover a slave boy on Tatooine called Anakin Skywalker who's chock full of Midi-chlorians.

Unfortunately, the Jedi council isn't keen on training the child as a Jedi. But, while trying to protect Queen Padmé Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn is killed by Sith Darth Maul and in honor of his memory Obi-Wan Kenobi promises to train the kid. **Biiiiig mistake**.


## 2. Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones
